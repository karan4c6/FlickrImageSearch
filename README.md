# FlickrImageSearch

1. This app is 100% Kotlin.
2. Created the app using MVVM Clean architecture.
3. Implemented the Flickr image search api to display images in a 3 column scrollable view.
4. Since all the data to view is provided by the view model, the app survives configuration changes. The live data is used to post image data and is being observed by the activity.
5. Using material components such as card view and recycler view to construct the UI.
6. Using Gson, Retrofit and Glide library.
